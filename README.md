# Stock-Price-Prediction
📈 LSTM-based stock price prediction model using time-series analysis with data preprocessing, visualization, and RMSE evaluation in Python.
📈 Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

This project focuses on building a time-series forecasting model to predict stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The system preprocesses historical stock data by handling missing values, normalizing features, and splitting datasets into training and testing sets. Visualization techniques are used to analyze stock trends, and model performance is evaluated using RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).

The project demonstrates practical application of deep learning for financial forecasting using Python.
